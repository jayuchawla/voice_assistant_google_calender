# voice_assistant_google_calender
Your calender and note maker assistant developed using google's calender api and system's notepad facility.

NOTE: 1) First go to this link and follow up Step 1 and Step 2: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python. 
         A json file named as "credentials.json" will be downloaded, place it in the script's directory.
      2) As you run the script a browser window will open asking for permissions to access calender, follow the screenshots provided.
      3) Speaking "hey buddy" will make the bot listen to you.
      4) You can ask it for your schedule on a particular date/day or tell it to make a note.
         for eg: "do i have any plans on December 12th",
                 "am i busy on December 12th",
                 "what plans do i have on ...",
                 "what am i doing on ...",
                 "is my schedule occupied on .. ",
                 "am i free on ...",
                 "can i book ... ",
                 "can i plan ..."
                 "make a note",
                 "note down",
                 "keep a note"
